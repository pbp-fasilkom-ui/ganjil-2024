# Assignment 3: Forms and Data Delivery Implementation in Django

Platform-Based Programming (CSGE602022) â€” Organized by the Faculty of Computer Science Universitas Indonesia, Odd Semester 2023/2024

## Assignment Description

In this assignment, you have to implement the data delivery concept and apply several concepts learned in the tutorial.

Checklists for this assignment are:

- [ ] Create a `form` input to add a model object to the previous app.
- [ ] Add 5 `views` to view the added objects in HTML, XML, JSON, XML by ID, and JSON by ID formats.
- [ ] Create URL routing for each of the views added in point 2.
- [ ] Answer the following questions in `README.md` in the root folder.
     - [ ] What is the difference between `POST` form and `GET` form in Django?
     - [ ] What are the main differences between XML, JSON, and HTML in the context of data delivery?
     - [ ] Why is JSON often used in data exchange between modern web applications?
     - [ ] Explain how you implemented the *checklist* above step-by-step (not just following the tutorial).
- [ ] Access the five URLs in point 2 using Postman, take screenshots of the results in Postman, and add them to `README.md`.
- [ ] Perform `add`-`commit`-`push` to GitHub.

## Deadline

The deadline for Assignment 3 is **Wednesday, 20th September, 2023, at 12:00 p.m.**

We will check the last commit of the lab assignment repository, so you do not need to submit the repository link separately.

## Bonus

You will gain bonus points for this assignment if you implement the following feature.

- [ ] Add a message "You have saved X items in this application" (with X being the number of data items stored in the application) and display it above the data table. The sentence can be customized to match the application's theme but must convey the same meaning.
