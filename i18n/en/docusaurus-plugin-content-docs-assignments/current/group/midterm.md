# Midterm Project

**Develop a Website using Django Web Framework (in groups)**

---

## Learning Objectives

1. Design web pages
2. Build a website using Django web framework that follows MTV (Model-Template-View) architectural pattern
3. Use a CSS framework or toolkit to implement Responsive Web Design
4. Write unit tests and deployment (bonus)

### Notes

In addition to the [learning objectives](#learning-objectives) above,
you must also learn several scholarly aspects expected from potential bachelor graduates.
Among those that are relevant in this course are grit, independence, rigor, and metacognition.
In other words, you are expected to have the ability to set learning strategies that suit oneself including planning, monitoring, and evaluating their independent learning process.
This includes the ability to understand, communicate problems, discuss, and ask questions.

You also need to have a positive attitude when dealing with various circumstances that may affect you in positive or negative way.
Although it may be difficult to be always in positive attitude,
try to strive for it so any circumstances can be beneficial in regards to achieving the previously mentioned scholarly aspects.

A negative attitude will only make things worse and eliminate the benefits of this project as a learning experience that will be useful in the future.
The teaching team (lecturers and teaching assistants) will try their best to assist you in the learning process so you can keep pace with the course and learn as much as possible.

As an intermezzo, there is a video (attached below) that is quite popular and hopefully can entice you to keep working hard and practising for your success in the future:

Good luck and have a great time working on the project! ðŸ˜„

## General Rules of the Project

1. Each group comprises of 4-5 person. Group members assignment can be seen on SCELE.
2. Each group should create a single Git repository on one GitHub [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) that all group members use to collaborate. Share the link to your group's Git repository through a submission slot on SCELE.
3. Each group may propose their own ideas for the application they are building. The theme for the application is **books and literacy**.
4. Each group implements a book catalog in the form of class models and stores data from the dataset into the Django database. The book catalog dataset must contain a minimum of 100 books. The source of the book catalog dataset can come from anywhere, for example, from Project Gutenberg, Google Books API, Kaggle, and LONTAR Thesis Data."

    Here are some examples of dataset URLs that can be used:
    - Project Gutenberg: <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/offline_catalogs.html> dan <https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/feeds/pg_catalog.csv>
    - Google Books API: <https://developers.google.com/books/>
    - Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=book>
    - LONTAR Thesis Data: <https://univindonesia-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/iisafriyanti_office_ui_ac_id/EcOI_lrVaVtHhvOF3foZJ7kBDXPWaOmyTtUCiMYzjLKJdw?e=BgcFSQ>
5. Each group member should work individually on a module. The modules will be decided by the group during project planning in the group and should be suitable for implementing the project idea.
6. The midterm project is submitted as a unified web application.

## Aturan Khusus per Anggota Kelompok

1. Implement _models_ by writing their own models, reusing models provided by Django, or using models developed by other group members in separate module.
2. Implement _views_ to handle incoming requests and produce HTML/JSON-based responses.
3. Implement HTML templates with a systematic and efficient structure, such as `base.html`, `header.html`, and `footer.html`.
4. Implement _templates_ using CSS framework/toolkit that assist in implementing responsive design (such as: [Bootstrap][https://getbootstrap.com/], [Tailwind][https://tailwindcss.com/]).
5. Implement a page with a form that accepts user input that shall be processed by views. Examples of processing by views include inserting data into the model, querying data from the model, and updating data in the model.
6. Implement client-side scripting and asynchronous data loading (AJAX) using JavaScript.
7. Implement authentication and authorisation on a certain part of the functionality implemented in the module. For example, a menu is only visible when the user has logged in and authorised to view the hidden menu.
8. Implement filters on the displayed book catalog dataset. For example, displaying a list of books based on the author's name.
