# Final Project

**Develop a Mobile Application using Flutter Framework (Group Project)**

---

## Learning Objectives

By undertaking this group project assignment, you and your teammates are expected to be able to:
1. Implement a simple mobile application using the Flutter framework.
2. Apply widgets for layout and input, event handling, and asynchronous calls to web services.
3. Deploy the application on both cloud platforms and mobile devices.

## General Rules of the Project

1. Each group creates a GitHub repository used by all group members to collaborate. Submit the GitHub repository link to Scele.

2. The GitHub repository must contain a `README.md` file with the following information:
    - List of group members.
    - Link to the APK (**Not required during Stage I; can be added to `README.md` later after completing Stage II**).
    - Application description (**name and function of the application**).
    - List of implemented modules with the distribution of work per member.
    - User roles or actors in the application.
    - Integration flow with the web service to connect to the web application created during the Midterm Project.
    - Link to the report documents/sheets.
    
3. Application deployment:
    - Upload the APK as a GitHub Release on the group's GitHub project page.
    - Use a cloud platform such as Microsoft App Center or Firebase App Distribution.
    - Use the group's own application logo.

## Specific Rules for Each Group Member

Each group member must work on a single module, and each module must:

1. Implement widgets for layout and input (Material/Cupertino, according to the group's integration).

2. Implement event handling.

3. Implement asynchronous calls to the Django web service (web application created during the midterm project).

4. Process JSON response data from the Django Web Service and display the results in the Mobile App.
